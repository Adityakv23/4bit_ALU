ALU OPERATIONS:
===============

| Opcode | Operation | Description                    |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| 000    | ADD       | Addition (A + B + Cin)        |
| 001    | SUB       | Subtraction (A - B - Cin)     |
| 010    | AND       | Logical AND (A & B)           |
| 011    | OR        | Logical OR (A | B)            |
| 100    | XOR       | Logical XOR (A ^ B)           |
| 101    | NOT       | Logical NOT (~A)              |
| 110    | SLT       | Set if Less Than (A < B ? 1:0)|
| 111    | SLL       | Shift Left Logical (A << 1)   |

STATUS FLAGS:
=============

- Zero Flag: Set when result equals zero
- Negative Flag: Set when result is negative (MSB = 1)
- Carry Out: Set when arithmetic operation produces carry
- Overflow Flag: Set when arithmetic operation causes overflow

NUMBER REPRESENTATION:
======================

- 4-bit signed numbers: Range from -8 to +7
- Two's complement representation for negative numbers
- Overflow detection for arithmetic operations

QUICK START:
============

1. Install Icarus Verilog and GTKWave
2. Run: make all
3. For waveforms: make wave
4. For Python visualization: python alu_visualizer.py test

TEST COVERAGE:
==============

- All 8 ALU operations tested
- Edge cases and overflow conditions
- Positive and negative number operations
- Zero and negative result conditions
- Carry generation and propagation
- Logical operation combinations

DEPENDENCIES:
=============

Required:
- Icarus Verilog (iverilog, vvp)
- GTKWave (for waveform viewing)

Optional:
- Python 3 (for alu_visualizer.py)
- Make (for automated build system)

PLATFORM SUPPORT:
=================

- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
- macOS (with Homebrew)
- Windows (with Icarus Verilog installed)

This project provides a complete educational and practical implementation
of a 4-bit ALU suitable for digital design courses, FPGA development,
and understanding computer architecture fundamentals.
